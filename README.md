Description : This repository contains a Python implementation for converting audio files to text, including the capability to segment the audio clip. Converting audio to text, also known as speech recognition, is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) and has various applications, such as transcribing interviews, generating closed captions for videos, and enabling voice-controlled interfaces.
Introduction : Audio to text conversion involves processing audio signals and extracting meaningful textual information. In this repository, we provide a Python implementation that utilizes various libraries and techniques for accurate speech recognition. Additionally, the implementation includes functionality to segment the audio clip into smaller parts, which can be useful for processing long recordings or dealing with multiple speakers.
The core functionality of this implementation relies on deep learning models trained on large datasets of speech data. These models are capable of recognizing speech patterns and converting them into text with high accuracy. The segmented audio clip feature allows users to break down long audio recordings into smaller chunks, which can then be transcribed individually for better accuracy and efficiency.
